the interface to metanet
with thredz you can...
create, organize, store, mint, control, publish, share, collaborate
you own all your data
you decide what and how to publish

take your keys and reconstitute your thredz in your own application
store many types of media or data files
create relationships between thredz
mint nft and access tokens
use any compatible smart contract or token system (initially stas)
use bitcoin script, superscript, or any compatible language to transform and operate on your thredz
